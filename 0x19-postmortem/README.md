Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM on February 14th, 2024 (UTC timezone).

Impact: The outage affected the authentication service, resulting in users being unable to log in to their accounts. Approximately 30% of users attempting to access the service experienced login failures during this period.

Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication service's database connection settings, leading to database connection failures.

Timeline:

10:00 AM: The issue was first detected when a spike in error rates was observed in the authentication service logs.

10:05 AM: Monitoring alerts triggered, indicating elevated error rates and latency in user authentication requests.

10:10 AM: Engineers began investigating the issue, initially suspecting potential network connectivity issues.

10:20 AM: Further analysis revealed database connection errors, leading to a shift in focus to database-related issues.

10:40 AM: Misleading investigation paths were pursued, including reviewing recent code deployments and examining server logs for unusual activity.

11:00 AM: With no immediate resolution in sight, the incident was escalated to the database administration team for additional support.

11:20 AM: The database administration team identified the misconfiguration in the database connection settings as the root cause of the issue.

11:30 AM: The misconfiguration was corrected, restoring normal database connectivity and resolving the authentication service outage.

Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The issue stemmed from an incorrect configuration in the authentication service's database connection settings, causing the service to fail in establishing connections to the database.

Resolution: The misconfiguration was rectified by updating the authentication service's database connection settings with the correct credentials and connection parameters.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement regular audits of database connection settings to ensure accuracy and prevent similar misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms to provide early detection of database connectivity issues.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a comprehensive review of all service configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.
Implement automated tests to validate database connectivity during deployment pipelines to catch misconfigurations before they impact production.
Schedule recurring training sessions for engineering teams to reinforce best practices for managing service configurations and troubleshooting database-related issues.
By implementing these measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future and enhance the overall reliability and resilience of our systems.
